This project creates a Tkinter interface called Quickmedia. The Media menu lets one choose a newspaper, and the titles of the last news articles are shown in the main frame. 

On startup, the application asks for the link returned on sign up at newsapi.org and stores the API key in a file data.txt on the current directory.
